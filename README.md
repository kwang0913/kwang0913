### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Rutgers University ECE Department](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Athina Petropulu](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~cspl/). Before joining the program, I earned my Bachelor's degree with a double major in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/) and [Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/), as well as a [Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science](https://msds-stat.rutgers.edu/msdatascience), both from Rutgers University.  

My current research focuses on building efficient and effective Multiple-Input Multiple-Output ([MIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO)) Joint Communication and Sensing ([JC&S](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/best-readings/integrated-sensing-and-communication-isac)) wireless systems using Orthogonal Time Frequency Space waveform ([OTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Time_Frequency_Space)). My work aligns with the [roadmap for next-generation (6G) wireless systems](https://research.samsung.com/blog/All-set-for-6G) and has been published in top-tier JC&S conferences (ICASSP, EUSIPCO, IEEE JC&S Symposium, etc.) and journals (IEEE JSAC, etc.).  

I have also collaborated on designing learning-based WiFi-sensing algorithms using off-the-shelf IoT devices; this work appeared in a top-tier systems conference (SenSys) and was later submitted to a journal (IEEE TMC). My research involves modeling the physical phenomena in wireless systems using Probability Theory and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and enabling various applications through algorithm design using Convex Analysis, Bayesian Analysis, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.  

Apart from my academic journey:

- :tennis: I have been an active tennis player since 2019.
- :fork_and_knife: I enjoy cooking and can capably host a party for twelve people.
- :school_satchel: I have served as a TA and a lecturer for an undergraduate-level [Probability Course](https://github.com/kwang0913/MyLatex/tree/main/ECE226) and Cryptograph Course.

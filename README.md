### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Ph.D. student at the [Rutgers University ECE Department](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Athina Petropulu](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~cspl/). Before joining the program, I earned my Bachelor's degree with a double major in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/) and [Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/), and a [Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science](https://msds-stat.rutgers.edu/msdatascience), both at Rutgers University. I have a solid background in Real Analysis, Probability Theory and Statistical Modeling. My research interests are Convex Analysis, Kernal Deep Learning and Bayesian Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on Deep Unfold Neural Network and its applications on Reconfigurable Intellegent Surface (RIS) and Orthogonal-Time-Frerquency-Space (OTFS) Modulation.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Ph.D. student at the [Rutgers University ECE Department](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Athina Petropulu](http://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~cspl/). Before joining the program, I earned my Bachelor's degree with a double major in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/) and [Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/), and a [Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science](https://msds-stat.rutgers.edu/msdatascience), both at Rutgers University. I have a solid background in Mathematical Analysis and Statistical Machine Learning. My research interests are focused on using mathematical analytical tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks in Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms, with consideration of their statistical properties. Currently, I am working on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), Deep Unfolding Network, and their joint applications in designing lightweight, real-time, efficient DSP algorithms, specifically for Mobile Relay Beamforming Networks and Compressed Sensing.

Apart from my academic journey:

- :tennis: I am an active tennis player with three years of experience and knowledge of tennis equipment.
- :fork_and_knife: I enjoy cooking and can capably host a party for twelve people.
- :hammer: I am a handyman with a knack for many diverse skills, though some may be less practical.
- :airplane: Travel is one of my passions.
- :money_with_wings: I am also interested in investments.
- :car: I used to be an avid car enthusiast, though not as much recently.
- :school_satchel: Teaching is a passion of mine. I have served as a TA and a lecturer for an undergraduate-level [probability course](https://github.com/kwang0913/MyLatex/tree/main/ECE226).
- :sunny: I am an ENFJ/ENTJ for those who are interested in the MBTI personality types.
